# FAT-APP
This app is designed to be a way for users to create their own workout sessions and schedule them for reminders so that they can maintain a healthy lifestyle. They can use the app to view stats and see how much they have progressed. Users can also use the app to manage their calories to help them reach their ideal body goal. This ideal body goal could be to lose a specific amount of weight, or to maintain their caloric intake with proper exercise. They can write down their specific workout routines, which will grant a total caloric loss, and the time it takes to do the workout. The app will also allow the user to create their own specific exercise by inputting specific attributes, such as calories burned or time it takes to complete an exercise. The app will be able to take this information and compare it with the calories consumed from a meal plan, which will then give a net total. Using the calendar, they can set the exact date and time for their workout(s), so the app can send reminders to motivate the user to keep up and obtain their ideal body goal.
